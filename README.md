A powerful extension for MyAnimeList which turns the site into a streaming site! Using various (more or less legal) methods this script fetches
and embeds a stream for your favourite shows.

Why am I even writing this... No one should actually use this, I don't want any legal trouble... I just want the nice "install" button so I don't have to install it manually...
